# AvengersPad
 
Welcome users, this is a iOS AR application that displays a video of a detected image. In this case, the iphone is searching for the cover of the recent Avengers Endgame movie. Once it has detected a matching cover, a mp4 video is displayed above the cover via a plane. 

# Inspiration 

I got this idea from dream about wearing google glasses and seeing a large billboard with the video being displayed in front of it. After a little research and dedication, I decided to try to make it into reality by creating the next best thing. Using Apple's AR kit, the cover is scanned and the video is shown as in augmented reality.
